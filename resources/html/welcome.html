					<h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
					<p>My name is Henry Miskin, I have just completed a undergraduate degree in <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/undergraduate/courses/mechanical_engineering/h300_beng_mechanical_engineering.page">Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southampton</a> and am going onto a masters in <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pgprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/computing/postgraduatecourses/computingscience">Computing Science at Imperial College</a>. I have moved into computing science through a fondness of technology and programming. I have worked on web development both in internships and in my free time.</p>
					<p>This website is primarily a showcase of myself and a number of the projects that I have undertaken. In addition this site serves as an environment in which I can practice my web development. The styling and interactivity contained within this site is through <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>
					<p>To navigate around please either scroll down to look at some of the projects that I have worked on or click the projects link at the top of the page. To find out more about a technology used in any of the projects then click the logo to filter the projects by that technology. You will notice the search field change when a project is selected to view all results again please click the red cross to cancel the search.</p>
