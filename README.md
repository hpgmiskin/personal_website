personal_website
================

This repository contains the source files that I have used to create my
personal website. My personal website is a simple single page site that
contains a list of technology projects that I have been involved in and
the technologies that were used in the projects.

This site uses AngularJS to provide an interactive user experience where
the content on the page can easily be searched and when clicking on a
technology the projects will filter based on the technology selected.

The formatting of the site uses Bootstrap to which allows the website
content to be viewable on a range of devices with easily understandable
user interface.

Please feel free to use any code snippets which are useful for non profit
purposes, however I request that any usage is referenced to me.
