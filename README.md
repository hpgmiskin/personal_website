#personal_website

##Description

This repository contains the source files that I have used to create my
personal website. My personal website is a simple single page site that
contains a list of technology projects that I have been involved in and
the technologies that were used in the projects.

This site uses AngularJS to provide an interactive user experience where
the content on the page can easily be searched and when clicking on a
technology the projects will filter based on the technology selected.

The formatting of the site uses Bootstrap to which allows the website
content to be viewable on a range of devices with easily understandable
user interface.

##To Run

To run this website it is most convenient to use Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder which contains the website contents. Then type in one of the following lines (depending on your Python installation).

######Python 2.7

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

######Python 3

    python -m http.server 8000

When the server is running open your browser and navigate to.

    localhost:8000

To stop the server press `Ctrl + C` when in the terminal window.
